1. For each of the following vocabulary terms, write a concise 1-2 sentence definition or description. Be brief, and
to the point.

Boolean expression: an expression in Python that equals True or False. 

While loop: a type of loop that iterates over itself while true.

Git: Git is version control software for storing your code. You can create repositories for projects you are working on to upload your code to.

2. List 4 Python data types: bool, int, float, string

3. Your friend missed the class on if-statements. Write down an example if-statement block of code that
includes the keywords “if”, “elif”, and “else”. Make sure to use proper syntax and indentation.

test = 'hi'

if test == 'hi':
  print('hi if statement')

elif test == 'hi':
  print('goodbye if statement')

else:
  print('none found')   

4. Please write a Python program that prints the value of y(t) = 0.5 × t 2 at t = 3. Your answer must
implement this expression (that is, your program should not be “print(4.5)”, and the number 4.5 should appear
nowhere in your program). For full credit, all variable names should be valid and any mathematical expressions
must use valid Python operators.

t = 3
y = .5 * t ** 2
print(y)

5. The following code has an error. Describe the problem and the fix

from sin import math
x = sin(1.0)
x = x * 3
print( x )

The first line import is wrong. Should read "from math import sin".

6. The following code has an error. Describe the problem and the fix.

Tn = [0.0]

for i in range(1, 9):
    Tn = Tn + i

print(Tn)

Line 3 has an error. An int cannot be added to a list. If you removed the brackets in line one, then the code would work

7. The following code has an error. Describe the problem and the fix

x = 7
if x = 7:
    print("x is 7")
else:
    x = x + (1.0j)**2.0

print( type(x) )

The comparison in line 2 is incorrect. It should read "if x == 7".

8. Pretend you run the following program on the terminal (or in spyder). Write down exactly what the
output would be.

x = 10.0

if x/10.0 == 1.0:
    print( type(x) )
    x = 3

print( x )

if x > 7:
    print("a")
elif x > 2:
    print("b")
elif x > 1:
    print("c")
else:
    print("d")

print( x )

-------------------

float 3 b 3

9. Pretend you run the following program on the terminal (or in spyder). Write down exactly what the
output would be.

my_list = [20, 7, -1]

output = 0.0

for x in my_list:
    if x >= 11:
        output = output + 2
    elif x >= 0:
        output = output + 1
    else:
        print("no change")

print(output)

--------------------

no change 3.0

10. Pretend you run the following program on the terminal (or in spyder). Write down exactly what the
output would be.

pow10 = 1.0
loops = 0.0
while pow10 <= 100:
    print(pow10)
    loops = loops + 1.0
    pow10 = pow10*10.0

print("Done with %f loops"%loops)

--------------------

1.0 10.0 100.0 Done with 3.000000 loops
