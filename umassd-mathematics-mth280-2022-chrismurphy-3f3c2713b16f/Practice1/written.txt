#1. For each of the following vocabulary terms, write a concise 1-2 sentence definition or description. Be brief, and
to the point.

command line program: programs that are run from terminal. Includes cd, ls, pwd etc. 

functions: a piece of code that attempts to accomplish a task with an input and returns an output.

modules: a back end import typically declared at the beginning of a program that allows you to use other peoples written code. ex: import numpy as np.

python list: a data type in python that can consists of floats, strings, ints (including a mixture of them all). Can be initialized by my_list = list() or my_list = []. 

#2. List 2 Python packages or modules: numpy, math

#3. Describe the similarities and differences between for-loops and while loops.

Any for loop can be written as a while loop and vice-versa. Both iterate over a defined set of numbers and must include a base case.

#4. Fill in the table:

Expression:            Result:     Type:
1 + 2*3                7           int
“17” + “76”            "1776"        string
“17” - 10              error       n/a
len( list(range(3)) )  3           int
sum([20,40])           60          int
[10] * 0.5             error       n/a
not (True and False)   True        bool
[2] + [“2”]            [2, "2"]    list
print(”%e”%(.01))      1e-2        n/a

#5. Pretend you run the following program on the terminal (or in spyder). Write down exactly what the
output would be:

N = 2
i = 0
my_list = [True, False, False, True]
counter = 0

while i < N:
	if my_list[i]:
		counter = counter + 1
	i = i + 1

print(counter)
------------------------------------

1

#6. Pretend you run the following program on the terminal (or in spyder). Write down exactly what the
output would be.

x = 10.0

if x / 10 == 1:
	print("a")
	x = 3
else:
	print("b")
	x = 7

if x / 2 <= 5.0:
	print("c")

if x * 1.5 <= 25:
	print("d")
elif x * 1.5 <= 20:
	print("e")

print( type(x) )
-------------------------------------

a
c
d
<class 'int'>

#7. Pretend you run the following program on the terminal (or in spyder). Write down exactly what the
output would be

for x in range(1,5):
	if x < 2:
		print( "cup" )
	elif x > 3 and x <= 6:
		print( "cake" )
	else:
		print( "cuppy" )

-------------------------------------

cup
cuppy
cuppy
cake

#8. The following code has an error. Circle the line and explain whats wrong.

e = "2.718"
pi = 3.14
pie = str(pi) + e
print( int(pie) )
print( int(pi) )
print( pie )

The line "print( int(pie))" will cause an error due to trying to convert a string into a int.

#9. The following code has an error. Circle the line and explain whats wrong.

from sin import math
x = sin(1.0)
x = x * 3
print( x ) 

The import is incorrect. It should read from math import sin.
